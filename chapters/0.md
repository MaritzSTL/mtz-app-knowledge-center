The best way to understand Polymer is not by talking about Polymer, but by talking about what Polymer represents. What Polymer represents is a profound shift in what browsers—Firefox, Chrome, and Safari—can do.

I'm a nerd who's supposed to know about this stuff—I’ve been reading about Polymer for years—but it wasn't until I actually started building things with it that I finally got it. What's going on is really cool and, for reasons I will explain, neither well-marketed nor well-understood.

So, here's my promise: once you've finished reading this one chapter, you'll be able to understand what Polymer is all about better than most of the nerds out there.

But, before I discuss web components, I'm going to explain the internet. But let’s get something straight: this will not be complicated. Even if you're the most non-technical person ever, you will be able to understand this. Here goes:

All that's happening on the internet is computers flinging large text files at each other.

![computers flinging text files at each other](images/chapters/0/01.png)

That's it. If you've ever dealt with a large text file, then you understand this. It's that simple.

When your computer receives a big text file, it needs to figure out what to do with it. Since the advent of the internet, every page you've loaded on your browser could be broken down into these three things:

![parts of an html document](images/chapters/0/02.png)

* Style - How the information looks
* Behavior - What happens when you interact with the information (a.k.a. click on things)
* Structure - How the information is arranged

So when you're clicking through a website, you're dealing with a bunch of Large Text Files™. These are called HTML documents.

![website as sequence of html files](images/chapters/0/03.png)

Most of the time, each page on a website doesn't actually just have all this stuff inside of it. What it does instead is **import** what it needs. All this means is that your computer yells at another computer to say, "hey! send me these specific large text files!"

![picture of importing](images/chapters/0/04.png)

You know how each web page can be extremely interactive? Candy Crush, NYT, infographics, Netflix, Youtube, cat pictures, so on and so on. The breadth of human experience can be conveyed through these HTML documents.

But the one thing that we've never been able to do is import HTML documents into other HTML documents.

![picture of html document crying because it doesn't have a heart](images/chapters/0/05.png)

Until now.

![picture of importing HTML docs into an HTML doc](images/chapters/0/06.png)

These HTML documents that we import into other HTML documents are called Web Components. And they let us do some crazy cool things that we've never been able to do before.

And they're a key part of a deeper strategy to keep the internet open.

## What About Frameworks?

When I first heard about Polymer, I immediately compared it to the closest thing I knew that I thought was like it. That is to say, other web frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, Ember, etc. (You might've never heard of these names, but you've definitely used them. Ex: Facebook and Instagram are built on React.) So for you very non-technical folk, Javascript is the purple box that gets pulled into these large text files. It lets you add behavior to a web page you visit.

Polymer and these other web frameworks all address the same question: when we fling a large text file at your computer, how do we do crazy cool stuff on it?

But where they're quite different is in *how* they address this. Web frameworks attack this problem at the Javascript layer. They try to shove all the changes they possibly can into the Javascript section of the HTML document.

![web frameworks attack layer](images/chapters/0/07.png)

Polymer is attacking this same problem, but at a different layer.

![polymer attack layer](images/chapters/0/08.png)

You can think of it like, all this time we've been building houses out of traditional building materials - wood, metal, concrete. But suddenly, we're being given a brand new kind of material we can build houses in (rainbows!). And more than that - we get to design what that material is, and how it works.

Web components are the new building material. Polymer is the process of designing what that material is. (Bet the name *Polymer* makes more sense now, doesn't it?)

The reason Polymer exists is because adding behavior to browsers is expensive, and requires a lot of coordination. When you make a request to a web page and some other computer flings an HTML document over to yours, both computers should show the same thing. It would be really frustrating and expensive to build websites if each browser interpreted that Large Text File™ differently. (Incidentally, this is why web developers hate old versions of Internet Explorer.)


So, the companies behind these browsers (Google, Apple, Mozilla) sit down together to figure out, when we get large text files and turn them into web pages, how do we make sure we all do that in the same way? They agree on what needs to happen, and then they go build their browsers however they want. The specifications that they agree on are called **Browser Standards**.

![browser standards picture](images/chapters/0/09.png)

Remember, web components are the new, never-before-seen building material for the internet. It's really expensive to have browser makers build changes. Before we add these changes to the browsers, how do we make sure we’re adding them correctly? And how do we know we're not adding changes that suck? Since we're getting the chance to design them, web components should be fun. They should make building things on the internet way easier. Otherwise, why are we doing this?

Well, building browser standards is expensive. But what if we tried them out someplace where experimentation was cheap? Then, we could see what works, what doesn't, and by the time all the browser makers have agreed upon what they’re going to build, we’ll know that we're only adding the good parts we know work well.

But where can we cheaply experiment?

The answer is: in Javascript! We can pretend that we're using web components but then change our minds because all we have to do is change out some Javascript. This is way cheaper than changing browser standards.

Even though Polymer is written in Javascript like all the other web frameworks, the point of Polymer is actually to flesh out what web components look like. This is so, when we create a good process for creating components, we can pop it off and actually build it into the browser.

![polymer getting added to browser standards](images/chapters/0/010.png)

This is definitely the most confusing part of Polymer, but it’s also the most important. Polymer isn't a web framework. Polymer is what the internet will look like in the future, a bit early.

This means, as a developer, as a manager, as *anyone who's involved with making websites*, the long-term risk of spending time learning Polymer is fundamentally risk-less. Because you're not learning about some framework that might get out of date. What you're learning is how all of the internet is going to work before everyone else.

Short-term, Polymer is the place where experimentation happens. So although the fundamentals won't change, the specifics will.

### Why Polymer Marketing Seems Bad

This is also why Polymer is poorly marketed. The people who agree on browser standards only meet a couple of times each year, and the team spearheading Polymer efforts at Google can't move faster than this schedule. Whereas Facebook, which builds the web framework React, can release, market, and blog about updates as soon as they happen, the Polymer team can't. The Polymer team’s success isn't people using Polymer. Rather, the Polymer team’s success is when Polymer shrinks and browser standards advance.

![shrinking polymer = success!](images/chapters/0/011.png)

Because of this, the Polymer team has adopted a different market entry strategy. Instead of targeting developers in general to use Polymer, the Polymer team targets specific large companies and convinces those places to use Polymer. This is because the Polymer team needs users, and it needs companies to build things that are good and useful.

One of the companies the Polymer team solicits is Google itself, which might seem confusing. If web components don't make it easier to ship enterprise-grade websites (e.g. Google), then they're no good. Thus, one of the Polymer team’s clients is actually the YouTube team.

Because of its unique objective, Polymer doesn't translate well through traditional marketing channels. That’s why you can't find much written about it on Hacker News, and that’s also why all the Polymer documentation that’s out there is written by highly technical people for highly technical people.

This is also why, despite reading about it for years, I never quite understood Polymer. And furthermore, it’s why I built this site: to make getting into this thing a whole lot easier.

## The Competitive Web

Why even have web components? Why are all these large companies putting in all this effort to do this in the first place?

Simple. You know who the web's biggest competitors are? Native apps. Websites you visit on your phone can't do two fundamental, incredibly important things:

* Work offline
* Load and run with good performance

### Working Offline

This might not be a big deal to you. You might be thinking, "so what?" Well, offline functionality for first world countries amounts to minor inconveniences. Not being able to browse on an elevator, temporarily losing your updates as you drive through a tunnel.

But for many places in the world (even America), the only connectivity they'll have is a spotty 3G connection. In fact, the vast majority of people who'll be coming online will live in these kinds of conditions. Offline functionality isn't some minor inconvenience - it's the difference between working or *not working at all*. At this point, most people who deal with building things on the web are familiar with "mobile-first" - designing websites and services first as they'll be used on mobile devices, then expanding to include desktop functionality.

This is 'another one of those' - a reality, an approach, that is both superior and adapted to the way the world is trending. So this isn't a choice of what, but when.

### Working Performantly

When you try loading a site on your phone...how long will you wait for it? Research says, 5 seconds.

When you pull down a web-framework based site over a 3G connection onto any kind of phone that's not a flagship released in/after 2015, it will take *15-20* seconds before the page even loads to a point of being usable. The majority of this time is spend on making network requests, and parsing javascript. *Fifteen* seconds. Ain't nobody got time for that. For more details, check out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWLzUnESylc).

If native apps keep outperforming the web over a long enough period of time, usage will shift heavily to native apps. This is bad for Google because they make money from people being on the web. But it's also bad for us. This means, instead of having one platform that can reach everyone, to build one thing, you'll have to have development talent for all the various walled gardens:

* Windows
* Mac
* iOS
* Android
* Whatever else

So that's really why all this effort is going into web components, and Google is spearheading it. And personally I find it really bad on another level. The promise of the internet is that it's open to everyone, it's a great equalizer of humanity. A shift to tons of native apps would be the end of that promise.

But actually, the effort here it goes a couple steps further than just web components.

What if, when browsing to a site on your phone, you could "tap to install" it so it showed up on your home screen? What if you could actually install websites and have them do cool things offline *like native apps*?

What if, by learning one platform really well, you could deploy competitive experiences that could reliably *reach everybody on earth*?

So this is what's actually going on here with this whole Polymer thing.

## Conclusion

**Spending your time learning Polymer has no long-term risk if you want to continue being a web developer, or working with people who deliver experiences over the web.** There is short-term risk, because it's an open experiment, so implementation details the details will change. But this risk is hedged because Polymer is in active use at huge companies to ship some of the most heavily used sites in the world, including Google, and they wouldn't burden themselves with tons of technical debt. So you'll need to update and keep up, but there will be tested and proven migration paths for those updates.

**Polymer and other web frameworks are not mutually exclusive.** In fact, it will work with them by default, because it *is* the internet. You can have your Polymer and your Angular, too.

![web frameworks and polymer](images/chapters/0/012.png)

**The point of Polymer is to eliminate itself and ultimately create websites competitive with native apps.** Tap to install, working offline, possibly (personal speculation here) even a default toolset of web components with native implementations.

**If you don't want to categorically cut yourself out of being able to reach [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD3rpdiLMyY](huge markets of people), web components are the way forward.** As a business, as a developer, as a designer, as a manager, as a *human on this earth*, the continued availability of open web standards will deeply affect your life in the coming years.

The rest of this guide is devoted to getting you up and running with exactly how to do this.

*p.s. - note for technical people. I know Polymer 3 is moving away from html imports, and towards es6 module-based importing, so *technically* what's described here won't remain specifically accurate. That's completely fine, and here's why: the point of this article is to quickly build the simplest and most useful mental model possible, for both technical and non-technical folk, to understand what the whole web components approach is. The idea of composable, encapsulated web pages getting pulled inside other web pages is more than adequate at achieving this, and the added complexity of needing to differentiate between imports would get in the way of understanding at this point. That is better covered in later chapters, at the right point in time!*
