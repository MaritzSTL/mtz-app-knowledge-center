The best way to understand Polymer is actually not talking about Polymer. What's really going on here is a deeper shift in what browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc) can do. I'll preface this by saying, I'm a nerd who's supposed to know about this stuff -- I've been reading about Polymer for *years* -- and it wasn't until I started building things in it and got through hours and hours of conference talks and documentation that I finally *got it*. What's going on is **really really** cool and, for reasons I will explain, not well marketed or understood.

So here's my promise. In the course of this one chapter, not only will I save you those hours and hours I had to spend to understand this, but once you're finished reading, you'll actually be able to understand what Polymer is all about better than most of the nerds out there.

## Web Components

First, before I get into web components, I'm going to explain the internet. But I want to get something straight. This is fundamentally not complicated. Even if you're the most self-professed non-technical person ever, you will be able to understand this.

All that's happening on the internet is computers flinging large text files at each other.

![computers flinging text files at each other](images/chapters/0/01.png)

That's it. If you've ever dealt with a large text file, then you understand this. It's that simple.

When your computer gets one of these big text files, it needs to figure out what to do with it. Since the beginning of time (on the internet), every page you've loaded up on your browser has been able to do these three things:

![parts of an html document](images/chapters/0/02.png)

* Style - how that arrangement looks
* Behavior - what happens when you click on things
* Structure - how it's arranged

So when you're clicking through a website, you're dealing with a bunch of Large Text Files™. These are called HTML documents.

![website as sequence of html files](images/chapters/0/03.png)

Most of the time, each page on a website doesn't actually just have all this stuff inside of it. What it does instead is **import** what it needs. All this means is that your computer yells at another computer to say, "hey! send me these specific large text files!"

![picture of importing](images/chapters/0/04.png)

You know how each web page can be extremely interactive? Candy Crush, NYT, infographics, Netflix, Youtube, cat pictures, so on and so on. The breadth of human experience can be conveyed through these HTML documents.

But the one thing that we've never been able to do is import HTML documents into other HTML documents.

![picture of html document crying because it doesn't have a heart](images/chapters/0/05.png)

Until now.

![picture of importing HTML docs into an HTML doc](images/chapters/0/06.png)

These HTML documents that we import into other HTML documents are called Web Components. And they let us do some crazy cool things that we've never been able to do before.

And they're a key part of a deeper strategy to keep the internet open.

## What About Frameworks?

When I first heard about Polymer, I immediately compared it to the closest thing I knew that I thought was like it. That is to say, other web frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, Ember, etc. (You might've never heard of these names, but you've definitely used them. Ex: Facebook and Instagram are built on React.) So for you very non-technical folk, javascript is the purple box that gets pulled into these large text files. It lets you add behavior to a web page you visit.

Both Polymer and these other web frameworks are trying to address the same thing: when we fling a large text file to your computer, how do we do crazy cool stuff on it?

But where they're quite different is in *how* they address this. Web frameworks attack this problem at the Javascript layer. They try to shove all the changes they possibly can into the Javascript section of the HTML document.

![web frameworks attack layer](images/chapters/0/07.png)

Polymer is attacking this same problem, but at a different layer.

![polymer attack layer](images/chapters/0/08.png)

You can think of it like, all this time we've been building houses out of traditional building materials - wood, metal, concrete. But suddenly, we're being given a brand new kind of material we can build houses in (rainbows!). And more than that - we get to design what that material is, and how it works.

Web components are the new building material. Polymer is the process of designing what that material is.

The reason Polymer exists is because adding behavior to browsers is expensive, and requires a lot of coordination across organizations. When you request any web page, and some other computer flings an HTML document over to yours, they should all show the same thing. It would be really frustrating and expensive to build websites if each browser interpreted that Large Text File™ differently. Nobody wants that. (Incidentally, this is why web developers universally hate old versions of Internet Explorer.)

So the companies behind all these browsers (Google, Apple, Mozilla) all have to sit down together and figure out, when we get these large text files that turn into web pages, how do we make sure we all do it the same way? They all agree on what needs to happen, and then they all go build it however they want. The specification they all agree on are called **Browser Standards**.

![browser standards picture](images/chapters/0/09.png)

So, remember, web components are a new, never-seen-before building material for the internet. It's really expensive to have all the browser makers go and build in changes. So before we add them to browsers, how do we make sure we get it right? How do we make sure we're not adding something that sucks? Since we're getting the chance to design them, using web components should be fun. They should make building things on the internet way easier. Otherwise, why are we doing this?

Well...building in actual browser standards is expensive. So what if we tried them out first in some place where experimentation was cheap? Then, we could see what works, what doesn't, and by the time all the browser makers sit down and agree on what to build, we know that we're only adding the good parts we know work well.

So then the question is, where can we cheaply experiment? The answer is: in javascript! We can pretend like we're using web components, but then change our minds, because all we have to is change out some javascript. And this is way cheaper than changing browser standards.

So even though Polymer is written in javascript like all the other web frameworks, the point of Polymer is actually to flesh out what web components look like. This is because, when we figure out a good part, we pop that off and actually build that into the browser.

![polymer getting added to browser standards](images/chapters/0/010.png)

So this is definitely the most confusing part of Polymer, but also the most important. Polymer isn't a web framework. Polymer is what the internet will look like in the future, a bit early.

This means, as a developer, as a manager, as *anyone who's involved with making websites*, the long-term risk of spending time learning Polymer is fundamentally riskless. Because you're not learning about some framework that might get out of date. What you're learning is how all of the internet is going to work before everyone else.

Short-term, Polymer is the place where experimentation happens. So although the fundamentals won't change, the specifics will. It's "bleeding edge."

### Why Polymer Marketing Seems Bad

And this is also why Polymer is seemingly so badly marketed. The people who agree on browser standards only meet a couple times a year, and the team spearheading this at Google can't move faster than this schedule. Where Facebook, who builds the web framework React, can release and blog and market about their updates as soon as they happen, the Polymer team can't really do this. Their success isn't people using Polymer. Their success is when Polymer shrinks, and browser standards advance.

![shrinking polymer = success!](images/chapters/0/011.png)

So the Polymer team has adopted a different market entry strategy. Instead of trying to get developers in general, they target specific, large companies like themselves and get those places to use Polymer. This is because they need users, and they need to build something good and useful for themselves. This even includes Google, which might seem confusing. Even though the Polymer team is at Google, if web components don't make it easier to ship enterprise-grade/internationalizable/accessible/performant websites, then they're no good. So one of their "clients," so to speak is the Youtube team.

What this means is, Polymer doesn't translate well through traditional developer marketing channels. This is why you can't find much about it on Hacker News, and pretty much all the documentation is written by highly technical people for highly technical people.

This is why, despite reading about it for years and being someone who's supposed to know about these kinds of things, it never made sense to me. And it's also the reason I built this site: to make getting into this whole thing easier.

## The Competitive Web

Why even have web components? Why are all these large companies putting in all this effort to do this in the first place?

Simple. You know who the web's biggest competitors are? Native apps. Websites you visit on your phone can't do two fundamental, incredibly important things:

* Work offline
* Load and run with good performance

And you know what else? You now consume the internet on your phone, your tablet, basically not desktop computers way more than before. And this trend is only getting stronger. On top of that, the majority of the humans on this planet who will be getting on the internet for the first time over the next couple of decades will be accessing it through 3G connections on old phones.

So that means, working offline, and working performantly (aka, actually working at all), are *really really* important attributes.

**Aside** (feel free to skip this paragraph if you're not a developer): When you pull down a web-framework based site over a 3G connection onto any kind of phone that's not a flagship released in/after 2015, it will take *15-20* seconds before the page even loads to a point of being usable. The majority of this time is spend on making network requests, and parsing javascript. *Fifteen* seconds. Ain't nobody got time for that. For more details, check out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWLzUnESylc).

If native apps keep outperforming the web over a long enough period of time, usage will shift heavily to native apps. This is bad for Google because they make money from people being on the web. But it's also bad for us. This means, instead of having one platform that can reach everyone, to build one thing, you'll have to have development talent for all the various walled gardens:

* Windows
* Mac
* iOS
* Android
* Whatever else

So that's really why all this effort is going into web components, and Google is spearheading it. And personally I find it really bad on another level. The promise of the internet is that it's open to everyone, it's a great equalizer of humanity. A shift to tons of native apps would be the end of that promise.

But actually, the effort here it goes a couple steps further than just web components.

What if, when browsing to a site on your phone, you could "tap to install" it so it showed up on your home screen? What if you could actually install websites and have them do cool things offline *like native apps*?

What if, by learning one platform really well, you could deploy competitive experiences that could reliably *reach everybody on earth*?

So this is what's actually going on here with this whole Polymer thing.

## Conclusion

**Spending your time learning Polymer has no long-term risk if you want to continue being a web developer, or working with people who deliver experiences over the web.** There is short-term risk, because it's an open experiment, so implementation details the details will change. But this risk is hedged because Polymer is in active use at huge companies to ship some of the most heavily used sites in the world, including Google, and they wouldn't burden themselves with tons of technical debt. So you'll need to update and keep up, but there will be tested and proven migration paths for those updates.

**Polymer is not a mutually exclusive choice with other web frameworks.** In fact, it will work with them by default, because it *is* the internet. You can have your Polymer and your Angular, too.

![web frameworks and polymer](images/chapters/0/012.png)

**The point of Polymer is to eliminate itself and ultimately create websites competitive with native apps.** Tap to install, working offline, possibly (personal speculation here) even a default toolset of web components with native implementations.

**If you don't want to categorically cut yourself out of being able to reach huge markets of people, you should be paying attention.** As a business, as a developer, as a designer, as a manager, as a *human on this earth*, the continued availability of open web standards will deeply affect your life in the coming years.

But most of all...I want to be able to build websites people can install, because that's SO FREAKING COOL!
