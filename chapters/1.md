The browser you're using to read this is, in my opinion, kind of a marvelous achievement of mankind. Under the hood, it's running on an engine. To understand this whole Polymer/Web Components thing, all you have to do is understand one really simple dynamic about how this engine operates.

So, I know the title says `<div>`, but I'm gonna actually gonna be talking about a different tag that's way easier to show.

## The <p> tag

The internet is a series of text files computers fling at each other. Here's what one of those looks like:

![example.html in the folder](images/chapters/1/00.png)

It's a file, just like any other. Here's what's inside of it:

![example.html contents](images/chapters/1/01.png)

When you double-click it, your computer will open it in a browser. Here's what you get:

![example.html rendered](images/chapters/1/02.png)

That `<p>This is a paragraph</p>` is called a paragraph tag. Whatever you put inside of it will show up as text, exactly like you might expect.

So, that's it. That's the agreement. It's that simple. If you, in your text file, add a `<p>` tag, any browser anywhere will render whatever you put inside of it as text.

The browser comes with a default toolset, a bundle of supported tags you can use. Every web page you read, every tweet you moan about, they're all built out of these tags. This is how the internet is built.

But what happens if we do this?

![example.html with internet shark first added](images/chapters/1/03.png)

We added `<internet-shark></internet-shark>`. So now what will happen when we open it in our browser?

![example.html rendered](images/chapters/1/02.png)

Nothing. Absolutely nothing. You see, since `<internet-shark>` isn't in the default toolkit of tags we get to use, our browser doesn't know what to do with it. And historically, this is how the internet has always been.

Until now.

## The internet shark

The most important thing this whole web components effort provides is the ability to let us add new tags. Or, in more accurate parlance, *elements*. They let us make new agreements with the browser, "when you see this thing, do that thing."

So, how do we make our new internet shark tag work? We have to register a new, custom, element. And as a non-technical person it's totally ok/not necessary to understand what this code is doing. (But some parts are intrinsically readable.)

```
<template id="internet-shark-template">
  <img src="../images/shark.png"></img>
</template>

<script>
  var internetSharkPrototype = Object.create(HTMLElement.prototype, {
    createdCallback: {
      value: function() {
        var t = document.querySelector('#internet-shark-template');
        var clone = document.importNode(t.content, true);
        this.createShadowRoot().appendChild(clone);
      }
    }
  });
  document.registerElement('internet-shark', {prototype: internetSharkPrototype});
</script>
```

The important bit is here, below. This is where we're creating a new agreement with our browser on, "if you see `<internet-shark>`, here's what you do."

```
document.registerElement('internet-shark', {prototype: internetSharkPrototype});
```

So, if we drop this into our text document we're feeding into the browser... what happens?

![internet shark first render](images/chapters/1/04.png)

**Boom!** Now our browser knows what to do. We have a fundamentally new kind of building material to work with.
