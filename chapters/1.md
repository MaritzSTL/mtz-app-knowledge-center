The browser that you're using to read this is, in my opinion, a marvelous achievement of mankind. In order to understand Polymer and Web Components, you must understand two rules about how the browser operates:

1. When a browser sees a specific tag, it does a specific thing.
2. A browser is a default bundle of specialized tags.

Let's talk about tags.

## The <p> tag

As we defined in the previous chapter, the internet is nothing more than computers flinging large text files at each other. Here's what a text file looks like:

![example.html in the folder](images/chapters/1/00.png)

It's a file, just like any other. Here's what's inside of it:

![example.html contents](images/chapters/1/01.png)

When you double-click the text file, your computer opens it in a browser. Here's what you get:

![example.html rendered](images/chapters/1/02.png)

That `<p>This is a paragraph</p>` is called a paragraph tag. Whatever you put inside of it will display as text, exactly as you might expect.

That's it. That's the agreement. If you, in your text file, add a `<p>` tag, any browser anywhere will render whatever you put inside of it as text.

The browser comes with a default tool set, a bundle of supported tags you can use. Every web page you read, every tweet you moan about—these are all built out of these tags. The internet is built out of these tags.

But what happens if we do this?

![example.html with internet shark first added](images/chapters/1/03.png)

We added `<internet-shark></internet-shark>`. What will happen when we open it in our browser?

![example.html rendered](images/chapters/1/02.png)

Nothing. You see, since `<internet-shark>` doesn't exist in the default toolkit of tags we're allowed to use, the browser doesn't know what to do with it. Historically, this is how the internet has always operated.

Until now.

## Adding the internet shark

The most important thing the web components effort provides us with is the ability to add new tags. Or, in more accurate parlance, to add new *elements*. Web components allow us to make an agreement with the browser that says, "When you see this tag, do that thing."

But how do we make our new internet shark tag work? We have to register a new, custom element and tell it what to do and how to behave. We'll skip the gory technical details of how to do that for now (see [Custom Elements](/chapter/3) for those details). But there's one line of code that's important:

```
document.registerElement('internet-shark', {prototype: InternetShark});
```

That line is where we create the agreement with our browser that says, "If you see `<internet-shark>`, here's what you do."

If we go ahead and build this `<internet-shark>` element and tell the browser about it, what happens?

![internet shark first render](images/chapters/1/04.png)

**Boom!** Now our browser knows what to do when it sees that text. This is what it's like to work with our new building material.

But why is the ability to create our own components, to create our own building material, such a big deal?

To answer that, we must first address the advantages and disadvantages associated with different types of building material.

## Why choose one programming language over another?

There are building materials, and there are building tools. Each has a set of properties which makes it more or less suited to solving certain problems. Have you ever tried hammering in a nail with a screwdriver? That would require a ton of unnecessary effort. Or hammering in a screw? That defeats the purpose of the screw; that's using a screw in such a way that goes against its nature. And why hammer in a screw when you have a perfectly good nail nearby?

Programming languages and tools are similar. They have properties that make them more or less capable of tackling particular tasks. Depending on which tools you select and how you assemble them, you adopt different configurations of costs.

For any business, cost is a given. What's actually important is when cost is incurred and how much. If a business incurs too much cost too soon, that business can tank. Alternatively, if that same business incurs more cost than desired, but not too much, at the beginning of production and as a result pays less in the long run, that business has just made a sound decision.

To boil it down: different businesses will incur different costs, and those costs are driven by which technical tools those businesses select.

## Cost

Cost is driven by the need for more and/or better software.

Any data-intensive technical system's cost is distributed across three areas:

1. Reliability
2. Scalability
3. Maintainability

Of those three, maintainability comprises the greatest portion of total cost.

> It is well known that the majority of the cost of software is not in it's initial development, but in it's ongoing maintenance. - Martin Kleppman

When your browser receives an HTML document and turns it into a usable web page, the segment of the technical stack that the user sees is called the "front-end". (The "back-end" is the servers which send the HTML document.) What do we need to consider when choosing the tools that we will use to build our front-end? What are the advantages and disadvantages to using each tool? By choosing one tool over another, what other tools are subsequently made unavailable? And, perhaps most importantly, what is the cost of maintaining what we build?

## Zooming in: Polymer/Web Components

Here's what a front-end approach of *any* kind needs to be able to deliver:

- Responsiveness (it looks good on many different devices)
- Internationalization
- Customizability (e.g. the ability to set colors, logos, etc. on a per-client basis)
- Option for offline expansion
- Performance (less than 100ms to interactive on desktop, less than 5s to interactive on mobile)
- Reusability

 One item on this list outweighs all others: performance. On most of the devices around the world, rendering a traditional, Javascript-framework-based front-end takes 15-20 seconds. The majority of that time is spent by the device making network requests and processing the Javascript.

This means there's only one way to improve performance: send less stuff.

There are no optimizations that can be made at the Javascript layer to improve performance unless that optimization is, quite simply, to send less stuff.

If the browser can do more, then you can send a lot less. But this goes even further. What if you sliced up your website into a bunch of little pieces, sent over only exactly what was needed, loaded those pieces in the most efficient way, and built the entire website on someone's computer?

![javascript vs browser based optimizations](images/chapters/1/05.png)

Well, that's actually what this site, which you're reading, does!

That's why being able to make your own custom elements is such a big deal. That's why something as simple as being able to enhance the browser, to add `<internet-shark>`, is actually huge.

And that's why Polymer/Web Components are such a big deal. If most of the people across the world can't consume content sent over the internet via a browser, something else will rise to fill that need. Right now, you can't consume the internet on a vast majority of devices if it's built in a Javascript-based web framework. Being able to send less, and do more, via these custom elements, is what will make browser-based internet usage able to happen.

So there isn't a mutually exclusive choice between React/Angular/Polymer. If Polymer/Web components don't work, then React/Angular are categorically irrelevant. And if Polymer/Web components *can* create a competitive web, then they'll probably be using Polymer/Web components. Because they're not another JS framework - they're the platform.
