## Your First Element

Finally, it's time to start getting our hands dirty!

*  Clone the knowledge center repository found [here](https://github.com/MaritzSTL/mtz-app-knowledge-center)
using your favorite version control system. This project contains our Polymer
coding sandbox.

*  Using the terminal, navigate to the cloned directory. You can see a lot of
material in the project but all we care about right now is the `tutorial` directory.

*  Navigate to the `tutorial/simple-element` directory.

## Start Out Simple
Listing the contents of the `tutorial/simple-element` directory reveals the typical
structure of a Polymer element. We have one or more html documents defining our
components (i.e, `simple-element.html`), various nested directories and some additional
files. For now, let's focus on `simple-element.html`. If you want clarification on the others that you see just
hang in there! We'll come to those later on in the tutorial.

*  Open `simple-element.html`.

Take a moment to scan the file and think about what you see. Don't worry if the
document appears strange at first. It always does. It'll make more sense as we
progress. However, a couple of important "Polymer-isms" can be found:
  1. The link at the top of the page with rel="import".
  2. The unfamiliar `<dom-module>` tag surrounding all of the page content.
  3. A `<template>` tag containing styles and other markup.
  4. Some JavaScript at the bottom of the page.

These four things combine to assemble a powerful construct called a *custom element*
which you'll come to know extremely well.

## Polymer Import and the Import Relationship
```html
  <link rel="import" href="../polymer/polymer.html">
```
HTML supports a `<link>` element which allows linking of one or more files to
the file in which the link is declared. The `rel` attribute specifies
the relationship that the target file (specified by `href`) has to the file containing
the `<link>`. In this case, this link is telling the browser to import
the contents of the file located at the relative path `../polymer/polymer.html`.
**Note: The Polymer import must be included at the top of the file**.

[comment]: <> (TODO How to indicate that the ../polymer/polymer.html href is referencing bower directory and is relative. Therefore, the location may change, etc.)

## `<dom-module>`

```html
  <dom-module id="simple-element">
    ...beautiful element stuff...
  </dom-module>
```

  While this element sounds like something out of a Star Wars episode, it's not.
Although it's still pretty awesome! Get ready for this incredible definition...
the `<dom-module>` element is used to specify a module of DOM. :-P If that doesn't
make sense, fear not. I'll go into detail.

#### The DOM
HTML consists of many different elements which come in the form
  ```html
    <element-name>
      ...some content...
    </element-name>
  ```
where an element has opening and closing tags and some content in between. For
example, in `simple-element.html` we can see the following:
```html
  <h2>[[prop1]]!</h2>
```
In this example, the opening and closing `<h2>` tags surround some content. So,
how is it that the browser understands what this snippet means and where to place
the content? The browser understands by constructing an model that represents the
document called the *Document Object Model*, or the *DOM*. This is really helpful
for us because it doesn't have to be static. For example, let's say the browser receives
an HTML file and constructs the DOM associated with that page. In order to update
the web page we can just update the DOM in the browser. This means content can be
dynamically added and removed from a given web page at runtime.

TODO Refine that above. Not well worded.

#### The Module  
So, that's all great. But what's meant by *module* here? Have you every heard the
phrase "Don't Repeat Yourself?" This phrase is commonly smashed into the acronym
DRY. DRY is a quick and easy way of suggesting that software should be designed
in a manner that maximizes reuse of code which, in turn, maximizes the value
offered by that code and minimizes the number of changes required to modify that
code. This isn't the only benefit afforded by modular code but it's a big one!
It's in this vein that we use the term module. A module is a collection of related
code.

#### So, What's a DOM Module?
Returning to our discussion of the `<dom-module>` element above, the ridiculous
definition I used is starting to make sense, right? The `<dom-module>` element
is, in fact, used to define a module of DOM. That is, a collection of related
code that defines what the browser 

## `<template>`


## JavaScript in an HTML Document?
